# Crank2Unlock
An artisanal Playdate jailbreak app that dumps your deviceâ€™s permanent unlock code.

Armed with this code, you gain low-level access to your device, incl. RAM and system partition.


#### The exploit code has been redacted from this public repo as I was not the one who discovered it.

Feel free to DM me at [@jankais3r](http://twitter.com/jankais3r) if you would like to have a `.pdx` for your personal [reverse-engineering research](https://github.com/jaames/playdate-reverse-engineering).
